You are developing a music player, with shuffle feature. Which randomise the songs played from a playlist.
Thereâ€™s a cool down number, c, meaning you should not repeat last  c recently played songs. The songs should be played completely randomised .

//  Time: O(1) space: O(1) 
//  Core Idea:ArrayList + queue
//  Init songs list and queue and a random generator
//  in shuffle, first generate a random number within the arraylist size
//  get and the song from random index
//  There are 2 case: 
//  coolDownQueue < k:
//  in this case, to avoid O(n time complexity of remove in arrayList),
//  we swap with last index, so we set the last index's value at rand and remove the last Index
//  and add the string in variable to queue
//  case 2 : coolDownQueue >= k
//  in this case, instead of setting the last index's value, we set the first value from queue
//  the polled value, and no need for removal as one song from queu has to come back to list
