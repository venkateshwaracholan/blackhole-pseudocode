/*

for DS and algo:

ask constraints for problems
method input and outputs
reiterate problem and confirm
expect followups and add extensible code, write object oriented, create custom classes,
write time complexity and space complexity
proper variable names
breakdown as functions
concurrency for problems
edge cases


concurrency + concurrent resources

for system design:

draw beautiful for system design
ask and write constraints, functional(usecase) and non functional requirements(scalability and config)
scale, active users, compute traffic and data size(like char count for tweet and image max size) back of the envelope calc
usecase + single machine micro service
APIs 
scale - ap -> LB + multiple nodes  
db => master slave, warmed up vs cold, read replica,geo sharding(based on region or user id), cache for read heavy, write heavy take async.
db indexing
if read write heavy => its a trradeoff
tradeoff and decision
cap theorem databases, ca, cp ,ap
monitoring and alerting



time series database
bloom filter
probablistic data structures

top k problem, priorityqueue, mapreduce to scale, 
chess game, board game,  findpossibilities, move,
